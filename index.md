Welcome! Our mission is to develop state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning algorithms for solving **intelligence** and **real world data problems**. For more information on research topics, please visit our [project page](projects/project). To know more about the lab, you may read this feature in [**SKKU Webzine**](https://webzine.skku.edu/skkuzine/section/culture03.do?articleNo=76954&pager.offset=0&pagerLimit=10) (in Korean).
