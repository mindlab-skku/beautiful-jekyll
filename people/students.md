<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Jae-joong is a graduate student in the Cocoan lab. He received IBS director's fellowship, which allowed him to do a lab rotation during his first-year graduate study. After a few-month search, he finally chose to join the Cocoan lab!! He is interested in developing fMRI-based biomarkers for basic neural processes, and ultimately wants to find building blocks of psychiatric diseases. He is currently working on a project developing pain predictive models based on fMRI dynamic connectivity patterns. He recevied his M.D. in Hanyang University.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">YongWook is a graduate student in the Cocoan lab. He received B.A. in psychology at Taylor University.  He is interested in the mind-body-brain interactions and wants to study the relationships between pain and its psychology aspects. He is also passionate about projects that will improve people’s physical and psychological well-being. He is currently working on a project highlighting an important methodological issue related to replicability crisis in human fMRI neuroimaging studies. </span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Byeol joined the Cocoan lab as a graduate student since the 2017 summer. She majored in astronomy and psychology at Yonsei University. She is interested in the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of social contexts and factors on subjective pain. She is currently working on a project developing computational models for the dynamics of internal thoughts. </span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Suhwan is currently a lab manager of the Cocoan lab (but will start his PhD in the lab beginning March 2018). He received B.A. in psychology at Sungkyunkwan University. His research interest is to understand how psychological health and biological factors influence each other. He is eager to answer the question of how the environment (e.g., personal background, contexts, cultures, etc.) affects subjective experience of pain and its brain activity.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Hong Ji will start her PhD in the Cocoan lab beginning March 2018. During undergrad, she double-majored in Biological science and Psychology. She is currently interested in understanding the links between neuroscience and social psychology, especially human motivation such as belonging motivation, self, intrinsic motivation, and regulatory fit. Understanding differences in neural representations of different types of pain--e.g., psychological, social, and physical--is also her interest.</span>
